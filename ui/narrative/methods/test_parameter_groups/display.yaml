parameters :
    genome_ref :
        ui-name : |
            A Genome
        short-hint : |
            What do you want here? Pick a Genome!
    free_text :
        ui-name : |
            Some Free Text fields.
        short-hint : |
            Just type some stuff, and it'll show up in the results.
    check :
        ui-name : |
            A Checkbox.
        short-hint : |
            Check it. Or don't. I'm a tooltip, not your boss.
    output_obj_name :
        ui-name : |
            Output object name
        short-hint : |
            Name of output object. Not like this really makes one.

parameter-groups :
    param_group :
        ui-name : |
            Parameter Group
        short-hint : |
            You just get one parameter group here. Use it wisely.

    <p>This App just shows off and tests parameter groups. That's it. Nothing fancy.
    <p>It takes in your inputs, and returns them somewhat formatted in a report view.
    Hopefully, it's useful for whoever wants to set up parameter groups.
